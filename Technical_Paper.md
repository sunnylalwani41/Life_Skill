# Website Scalling

## What Is Website Scaling?

Website scaling is a way to handle additional workloads by adjusting your infrastructure. The increased workload could be anything from an influx of users to a large volume of simultaneous transactions or anything else that pushes the software beyond its designed capacity.

## Vertical Scaling
With vertical scaling, you increase hardware capacity to give your software more resources to handle heavier workloads. Vertical scaling could mean switching to a server with a faster CPU, additional memory, or a variety of other factors that affect a computer's performance. Cloud services like AWS make it easy to increase computing power as needed to scale vertically. While vertical scaling is simple to achieve, it can quickly become costly, and there's a point where you can upgrade a piece of hardware any more and will need to add more servers to continue scaling.

## Horizontal Scaling
To scale horizontally, you provision new servers to run your software on - for example, with additional instances. With more instances of your software running, the workload can be distributed across them to process more of the workload at the same time. Typically, companies configure load balancers to distribute web traffic across software instances automatically. Horizontal scaling may be effective, but it also adds complexity to your infrastructure.
